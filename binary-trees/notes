buildtree
buildtree in levelorder
preorder postorder and inorder traversal
levelorder traversal
count leafnodes
height of a binarytree
(height and traversals using loop)
diameter of a binary tree(optimized and unoptimized approaches)
check balanced or not
isIdentical
zigzag traversal
boundary traversal
vertical order traversal
top/bottom view
left/right view
sum of the longest bloodline of a tree(done using pair(height, sum) approach) also try love babbar approach
LCA(lowest common ancestor of a binary tree)
k sum paths in a tree
kth ancestor in a tree(two approaches)
build tree from inorder and postorder and print its preorder
buildtree from preorder and inorder and print its postorder
